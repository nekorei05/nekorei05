##🌙 Hey, I’m Rei — aka Nekorei

(“Neko” = cat in Japanese 🐾 + Rei, my artist & developer identity)

I’m a developer who loves building clean interfaces, smooth user experiences, and full-stack projects that actually ship.
Currently creating MEWse, a full-stack music app — and learning everything from frontend to backend to cloud along the way.

##🚀 What I Do

Build modern UI with HTML • CSS • JavaScript

Develop APIs & full-stack apps using Node.js • Express.js • MongoDB

Design minimal, aesthetic user experiences

Debug until the bugs move out permanently

Blend creativity + logic in every project

##🎧 Current Focus — MEWse

A music streaming platform I’m building from scratch:
auth, dynamic UI, recently played, playlists, backend routes, custom audio player — everything.
It’s my “build it beautifully, learn it properly” project.

🧠 What I’m Learning Right Now

React.js for powerful UI

AWS Cloud fundamentals

API design + system design

Cybersecurity basics

🐾 About Me

Creative + logic-driven dev

Obsessed with clean UI

If I don’t understand something, I build it

Learn fast → build fast → break fast → fix fast
